PURPOSE
+++++++

The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar  with the Kustomize CLI, using
the standalone binary, as well as the version built into the Kubernetes client
CLI, kubectl.

REQUIREMENTS
++++++++++++

This exercise simply requires an installation of the Kustomize standalone
binary (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases). It also relies
on kubectl being installed, too. Information for installing kubectl can be
found here (https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kubectl/).

STEPS
+++++

 1. Get familiar with the Kustomize CLI using its help options.

kustomize --help
kustomize build --help
kustomize create --help
kustomize edit --help

 2. Find out which version of Kustomize you are using.

kustomize version

 3. Get familiar with the Kustomize options built into kubectl.

kubectl kustomize --help
kubectl apply --help | grep -C1 kustomize

 4. Find out which version of Kustomize is built into kubectl. Is it the same?

kubectl version --short

Exploring the help for the CLI helps to give you a better overview of the
options available. We'll get to use these commands as we progress.
