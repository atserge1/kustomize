PURPOSE
+++++++

The purpose of this exercise is to use Kustomize to create a variant of the
Kubernetes configuration for the example app we're using throughout the course.
The original configuration will be the base, and the variant will be created
from a Kustomization defined in an overlay.

REQUIREMENTS
++++++++++++

This exercise simply requires an installation of the Kustomize standalone
binary (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases).

STEPS
+++++

 1. Familiarize yourself with the directory structure and its initial content.

cd config
ls -lR
cat *.yaml

 2. Create a Kustomization in the base directory.

cd base
kustomize create --autodetect

 3. Inspect the new Kustomization in the base directory.

ls -l
cat kustomization.yaml

 4. Perform a kuild of the Kustomization in the base directory and check its
    content includes the Deployment and Service, but unaltered.

kustomize build .

 5. Create a Kustomization in the overlay directory, referencing the base
    directory as a resource.

cd ../overlay
kustomize create --resources ../base

 6. Add build metadata to the Kustomization, so that the rendered object
    definitions contain the 'managed by' label.

kustomize edit add buildmetadata managedByLabel

 7. Inspect the Kustomization in the overlay directory.

cat kustomization.yaml

 8. Perform a kuild of the Kustomization in the overlay directory and check its
    content includes the Deployment and Service, but with the 'managed by'
    label added.

kustomize build .

Congratulations, you've just created your first variant of the base
configuration using a Kustomize overlay. It's a simple transformation, but
serves to demonstrate Kustomize's use. We'll build on this as we progress.
